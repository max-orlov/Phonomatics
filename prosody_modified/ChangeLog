v0.1.1
	1. Add code in code/fetch. (fetch_f0_feature and fetch_energy_feature) to
	deal with the last word.
	2. Change pf_PHONES_IN_LAST_RHYME to vf_PHONES_IN_LAST_RHYME in
	code/derive.praat (derive_normalized_rhyme).
	3. Initialize values of the new rows appended to
	spkr_feature_table to zero. (new Praat versions requires
	initialization of table values prior to access table values.)
