We need to remove every data with the following IDs from the output:

1. WORD
2. VOWEL
3. RHYME
4. PHONE

We need to create:
1. script that creates a TextGrid file for 0.5 seconds of the input audio.
   1.1. each "word" should be a running index.
   1.2. xmin and xmax should be in 0.5 second resolution.
2. make sure that the phoneme file contains only 1 record ("") and the size is 1.
